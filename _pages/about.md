I am a PhD student in the [Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering](https://mie.utoronto.ca) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) under the supervision of Professor [Timothy C.Y. Chan](http://chan.mie.utoronto.ca). My primary research interests are in the application of optimization and analytics methods to resuscitation science and pre-hospital medicine.

I previously completed my Master of Applied Science and Bachelor of Applied Science degrees at the University of Toronto.
